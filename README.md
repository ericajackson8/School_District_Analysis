# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
In this challenge we worked with Maria to analyze the student performance data on recent standardized test.  We would like to compare student performance across schools as we know that performance on standardized test is a factor in school funding determination.
## Summary of Findings
Based on the analysis we were able to complete, we observe the following:
1. Charter Schools appear to have slightly higher math test scores than public schools; whereas, there appears to be no difference in student performance on standardized reading test.
2. Although test scores are slighlty higher for charter schools; the Average funding for public schools appears to be higher.  This does not follow the assumption standardized test performance determines funding.  Recommend looking at additional drill-downs to gain more insight.
3. Average math scores appear to be high for charter schools across all grades, except 12th grade. 9th graders at charter schools have the highest average and 12th grades at charter schools have the lowest.

## Additional Recommendations
Some additional analysis that might be worthwhile:
- Looking at the average funding per student.  While it appears that overall, the average funding for public schools is higher, this could be due to higher volume of students.  Looking at the per student rate, whould provide this additional insight and eliminate bias.
- Also looking at the reading scores within school type and grade might be worthwile to show insight into performance difference that cannot be seen by looking across all schools, and grades by school type.
- It could also be worthwile to look at performance by school type and school.
